# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project uses machine learning to analyze the sentiment of tweets. Tweets are classified as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content, providing insights into public opinion and trends.

## Main Steps

1. **Dataset Preparation**
    - Loaded a large dataset of tweets with sentiment labels (e.g., Sentiment140).
    - Cleaned tweets by removing URLs, mentions, special characters, and converting text to lowercase.

2. **Preprocessing**
    - Tokenized text data.
    - Converted words to vectors using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
    - Handled class imbalance and missing values if present.

3. **Model Building**
    - Split data into training and testing sets.
    - Trained models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or LSTM neural networks for sentiment classification.

4. **Evaluation**
    - Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    - Visualized confusion matrices and ROC curves.

5. **Prediction**
    - Applied the trained model to new tweets for sentiment prediction.
    - Provided examples of tweet sentiment predictions.
